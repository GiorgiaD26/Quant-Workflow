The Data ustilised are divided by typologies: Bond and Stocks (MSCI).
The focus of the analysis is on the correlation between the indexes, focusing on the one with the time series starting from the Seventies (beginning of globalisation).
Then, there is the construction of the portfolio, using the stocks and the bonds with the longest time series (1990s), to have the most appropriate evolution in time of portfolio composition.
The last analysis has been on the impact of the correlation, compared to the risk and the variance, on portfolio diversification.
The technique utilised is the Resampling and the Monte Carlo simulations on the returns computed using the time series of the prices.
